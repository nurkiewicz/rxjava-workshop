# RxJava workshop

## Instructions

Import to your favorite IDE and run [`com.nurkiewicz.rxjava.R00_SmokeTest`](https://github.com/nurkiewicz/rxjava-workshop/blob/master/src/test/java/com/nurkiewicz/rxjava/R00_SmokeTest.java).
It should build and pass.
Some tests do not have assertions and are merely used to observe the behavior manually.
